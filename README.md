# Wall-Aye
Abstractâ€” Our project, Wall-Aye, is a rear drive smart car 
that implements dual high-speed motors and other components, 
such as an ultrasonic distance sensor, two RGB LED headlights 
and two neopixel LEDs on the bottom, and two line-tracking 
probes. Using the ultrasonic and distance sensor, the car can 
autonomously drive in a space without bumping into a wall or 
any obstacle in front of it. The smart car will also be going on a 
straight path, in which will have to recording devices to show 
the real time clock or when it leaves the starting line and reaches 
the finish line. Lastly, the third mode of the car would be 
tracking a line using the line tracking sensor, and only moving
when it is tracking the line. This project is important because it 
introduces programmers and engineers to the basics of 
micro:bit. By understanding micro:bit, it can introduce users to 
more advanced projects. Similar to the self-driving electric car, 
Tesla, the project is able to detect the distance between objects 
so it can avoid a collision. This project is a known introduction 
project with micro:bit, and even with Arduino. Many have tried 
to make an autonomous car using micro:bit and Arduino. It is 
accomplished with various components such as distance sensors 
and light sensors, and tracking sensors, much in the same 
fashion as we are attempting to do. In terms of making the car 
autonomous, people have tried to solve it the same way, by using 
distance sensors and the other sensors mentioned above. There 
are also some people who use flex sensors. There are many ways 
of building the project we are doing, and micro:bit is proving to 
be an efficient microcontroller for such a project.
